- Use: General discussions

### 2. Interview
Host interviewing an expert
- Speakers: R (Host), S (Expert)
- Use: Q&A sessions

### 3. Roundtable
Multi-person discussion

## üí° Tips

1. **Keep turns concise**: 1-3 sentences per turn works best
2. **Use all speakers**: Distribute dialogue among available speakers
3. **Natural flow**: Include reactions and follow-up questions
4. **Emotional text**: Write emotions into the dialogue itself

## üåü Example
